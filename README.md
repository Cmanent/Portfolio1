#PORTFOLIO
My porftlio website show cases my abilities as a website developer. I truly love to style and play with color so my intention is to display my range as an artist. I developed a clean and highly stylized website, complete with an about me, contact page and project links. I included links to my Linked In and Git Hub profiles, where I have my best projects stared so any employer may inspect my work. So far I only have three major projects I feel comfertable displaying, with more soon to come! 

I created an email specifically for employers as well, which is displayed on my page and Linked In account.

Linked In: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carina-manent-8550b4197/"

This link lead to the pdf of my resume. It is my plan to link this on my home page.
